resume for a particular company. Features are the high level information. Accomplishments expound on that with some specific examples.
Benefits are what would appeal to the company. What's in it for them?</p>

<h2>Some random thoughts</h2>
<p>I am a Chicago-based freelance software developer.
</p><p>I have run my own company for the past ten years.
</p><p>I check in with my customers with regular weekly status reports, and sooner if its required.
</p><p>Nearly all of my client work has been done remotely.
</p><p>I love to create software that excites users and they wonder how they lived without it.

</p><p>I've built several apps using Ruby on Rails. I haven't dug into the details of Ember yet, but that's on the roadmap.
</p><p>I'm a hardcore hand-editing html and css guy since the mid-1990s. I like javascript, but often turn to jQuery because its so easy to use.
</p><p>The applications I've built in Rails have either used MySQL or PostgreSQL, but I'm also quite familiar with SQL through years of using SQL Server on the Microsoft development platform.
</p><p>Final scope was deployed to Heroku
</p><p>RSpec? Love it! Cucumber tests too. I pushed one of my jobs to use unit testing.
</p><p>I'm familiar with Spree, but haven't done any work with it.
</p><p>I've worked on teams of all sizes, both in person and remotely. 
</p><p>I know communication is important when working with a team, so I'll use any means necessary including email, chat, forums and smoke signals.
</p><p>Ship fast? ugh?
</p><p>In every role I have ever had, I've looked for ways to improve processes and products. This has been as simple as requiring developers to use source control (back in the day), to test-driven development as well object oriented
</p><p>Fun? I don't believe in fun. Or sombreros.
</p><p>I love consulting because of the ever-changing landscape of tools and technologies. Only in a consulting role does a software developer get thrown in to try new tools and find the solutions that solve problems.
</p><p>
</p><p>Agile:
</p><p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
</p><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation.
</p><p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
</p><p>Responding to change over following a plan
