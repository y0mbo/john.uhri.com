  <p>F.A.B. stands for Features, Accomplishments and Benefits. It's a recruiting tool to guide the design of a
resume for a particular company. Features are the high level information. Accomplishments expound on that with some specific examples.
Benefits are what would appeal to the company. What's in it for them?</p>

<h2>Some random thoughts</h2>
I am a Chicago-based freelance software developer.
I have run my own company for the past ten years.
I check in with my customers with regular weekly status reports, and sooner if its required.
Nearly all of my client work has been done remotely.
I love to create software that excites users and they wonder how they lived without it.

I've built several apps using Ruby on Rails. I haven't dug into the details of Ember yet, but that's on the roadmap.
I'm a hardcore hand-editing html and css guy since the mid-1990s. I like javascript, but often turn to jQuery because its so easy to use.
The applications I've built in Rails have either used MySQL or PostgreSQL, but I'm also quite familiar with SQL through years of using SQL Server on the Microsoft development platform.
Final scope was deployed to Heroku
RSpec? Love it! Cucumber tests too. I pushed one of my jobs to use unit testing.
I'm familiar with Spree, but haven't done any work with it.
I've worked on teams of all sizes, both in person and remotely. 
I know communication is important when working with a team, so I'll use any means necessary including email, chat, forums and smoke signals.
Ship fast? ugh?
In every role I have ever had, I've looked for ways to improve processes and products. This has been as simple as requiring developers to use source control (back in the day), to test-driven development as well object oriented
Fun? I don't believe in fun. Or sombreros.
I love consulting because of the ever-changing landscape of tools and technologies. Only in a consulting role does a software developer get thrown in to try new tools and find the solutions that solve problems.

Agile:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
